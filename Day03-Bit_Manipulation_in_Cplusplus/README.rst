## 🧠 **1. Introduction**

Bit manipulation is one of the most powerful tools in competitive programming and technical interviews.  
It allows you to:

- ⚡ Optimize operations to O(1)  
- 🔄 Replace loops with constant‑time bit tricks  
- 🧩 Solve problems involving subsets, masks, parity, toggling, and binary representation  
- 🚀 Write extremely efficient code for DP, graphs, and combinatorics  

Today’s goal is to build a **deep, intuitive, and practical** understanding of:

- 🧮 Binary representation  
- ⚙️ Bitwise operators  
- 🧩 Common bit tricks  
- 🔍 Checking, setting, clearing, toggling bits  
- 📊 Counting bits  
- ⚡ Fast exponentiation using bits  
- 🗂️ Subset generation using bitmasks  
- 🏆 Interview‑level problems

## **2. Binary Representation Refresher**

Every integer is stored in binary.

Example:  
```
13 → 1101
```

Bit positions (0‑indexed from right):

```
bit 3   bit 2   bit 1   bit 0
  1       1       0       1
```

## **3. Bitwise Operators in C++**

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `&` | AND | `a & b` |
| `|` | OR | `a | b` |
| `^` | XOR | `a ^ b` |
| `~` | NOT | `~a` |
| `<<` | Left shift | `a << 1` |
| `>>` | Right shift | `a >> 1` |

## **4. Core Bit Tricks (Must Know)**

---

### **4.1 Check if a bit is set**

```cpp
bool isSet = (n & (1 << k));
```

---

### **4.2 Set a bit**

```cpp
n = n | (1 << k);
```

---

### **4.3 Clear a bit**

```cpp
n = n & ~(1 << k);
```

---

### **4.4 Toggle a bit**

```cpp
n = n ^ (1 << k);
```

---

### **4.5 Remove the lowest set bit**

```cpp
n = n & (n - 1);
```

This is one of the most important tricks.

---

### **4.6 Extract the lowest set bit**

```cpp
int low = n & -n;
```

---

### **4.7 Check if a number is power of 2**

```cpp
bool ok = (n > 0) && ((n & (n - 1)) == 0);
```

---

## **5. Counting Set Bits**

---

### **5.1 Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm — O(k)**

```cpp
int count = 0;
while (n) {
    n &= (n - 1);
    count++;
}
```

---

### **5.2 Built‑in Function**

```cpp
__builtin_popcount(n);
__builtin_popcountll(n);
```

---

## **6. XOR — The Magical Operator**

XOR properties:

- `a ^ a = 0`
- `a ^ 0 = a`
- XOR is reversible  
- XOR is associative and commutative  

---

### **6.1 Find the unique element (all others appear twice)**

```cpp
int ans = 0;
for (int x : arr)
    ans ^= x;
```

---

### **6.2 Swap two numbers without temp**

```cpp
a ^= b;
b ^= a;
a ^= b;
```

---

## **7. Bitmasking — Representing Subsets**

A subset of an n‑element set can be represented using an n‑bit number.

Example:  
For `{a, b, c}`:

```
000 → {}
001 → {c}
010 → {b}
011 → {b, c}
100 → {a}
...
```

---

### **7.1 Generate all subsets**

```cpp
for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (mask & (1 << i))
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

---

## **8. Fast Exponentiation Using Bits (Binary Exponentiation)**

```cpp
long long power(long long a, long long b) {
    long long res = 1;
    while (b > 0) {
        if (b & 1)
            res *= a;
        a *= a;
        b >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
}
```

Time: O(log n)

---

## **9. Real‑World Examples**

---

### **Example 1 — Count number of 1s in binary representation**

```cpp
int cnt = __builtin_popcount(n);
```

---

### **Example 2 — Turn off rightmost set bit**

```cpp
n = n & (n - 1);
```

---

### **Example 3 — Check if kth bit is 1**

```cpp
if (n & (1 << k)) cout << "Yes";
```

---

### **Example 4 — Convert uppercase to lowercase**

```cpp
char c = 'A';
c = c | (1 << 5); // lowercase
```

---

### **Example 5 — Convert lowercase to uppercase**

```cpp
char c = 'a';
c = c & ~(1 << 5);
```

---

## **10. Interview‑Level Bit Manipulation Problems**

---

### **Problem 1 — Find the element that appears once (others appear twice)**

Solution: XOR all elements.

---

### **Problem 2 — Find two unique numbers (others appear twice)**

Use XOR + rightmost set bit trick.

---

### **Problem 3 — Find the unique number when others appear thrice**

Use bit counting.

---

### **Problem 4 — Count total set bits from 1 to N**
