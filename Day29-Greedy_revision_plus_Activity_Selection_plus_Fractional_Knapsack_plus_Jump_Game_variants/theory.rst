# **Day 29 – ⚡ Greedy Revision + 🎯 Activity Selection + 💰 Fractional Knapsack + 🏃 Jump Game Variants**  
`theory.rst`

# **🌈 1. Why Day 29 Matters**
Greedy algorithms are elegant, fast, and powerful — but only work when the problem has a **greedy-choice property** and **optimal substructure**.

Today you master:

- Interval scheduling  
- Ratio‑based optimization  
- Reachability in arrays  
- When greedy works (and when it fails)  
- How to identify greedy‑friendly problems  

These are **FAANG‑core** patterns.

---

# **🌟 MEMORY ANCHOR: “A‑K‑J”**
Three pillars of Day 29:

- **A** – Activity Selection  
- **K** – Knapsack (Fractional)  
- **J** – Jump Game  

Remember: **A‑K‑J** → Activities, Knapsack, Jumps.

# **🌈 2. Greedy Algorithm Philosophy (Revision)**

A greedy algorithm:

- Makes the **best local choice** at each step  
- Never revisits decisions  
- Works only when local optimum → global optimum  

---

## **🔥 When Greedy Works**
- Optimal substructure  
- Greedy-choice property  
- No future dependency  

---

## **🧠 MEMORY TIP:**  
**Greedy = No backtracking + No DP table**

---

# **🌈 3. Activity Selection (Interval Scheduling)**  
This is the **purest greedy problem**.

---

## **🎯 Goal**
Select maximum number of non‑overlapping activities.

Each activity has:

- Start time  
- End time  

---

## **🔥 Key Insight**
Pick the activity that **finishes earliest**.

---

## **🔥 Steps**
1. Sort activities by **end time**  
2. Pick the first activity  
3. For each next activity:  
   - If its start ≥ last selected end → select it  

---

## **🧠 MEMORY ANCHOR:**  
**Earliest finish → maximum room for future**

---

## **🎨 Example**
Activities:  
```
(1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (0,6), (5,7)
```
Sorted by end:  
```
(1,3), (3,5), (5,7)
```
Answer = 3 activities.

---

# **🌈 4. Fractional Knapsack (Greedy by Ratio)**  
This is the **classic ratio‑based greedy** problem.

---

## **🎯 Goal**
Maximize profit with weight capacity `W`.  
Items can be **broken into fractions**.

---

## **🔥 Key Insight**
Pick items with **highest value/weight ratio** first.

---

## **🔥 Steps**
1. Compute ratio = value / weight  
2. Sort items by ratio (descending)  
3. Pick full items until capacity left  
4. Take fraction of next item  

---

## **🧠 MEMORY TIP:**  
**Greedy works because fractions allowed**

---

## **🎨 Example**
Capacity = 50  
Items:  
- (value 60, weight 10) → ratio 6  
- (value 100, weight 20) → ratio 5  
- (value 120, weight 30) → ratio 4  

Pick in order: 6 → 5 → fraction of 4.

---

## ❌ **0/1 Knapsack is NOT greedy**  
Requires DP.

---

# **🌈 5. Jump Game Variants (Greedy Reachability)**  
These are **array reachability** problems solved using greedy.

---

# **🌈 5.1 Jump Game I (Can Reach End?)**

---

## **🎯 Goal**
Given `nums[i]` = max jump length from index i, determine if you can reach the last index.

---

## **🔥 Key Insight**
Track the **farthest reachable index**.

---

## **🔥 Steps**
1. Initialize `reach = 0`  
2. For each index `i`:  
   - If `i > reach` → cannot reach → return false  
   - Update `reach = max(reach, i + nums[i])`  
3. If loop ends → return true  

---

## **🧠 MEMORY ANCHOR:**  
**Greedy = keep extending reach**

---

# **🌈 5.2 Jump Game II (Minimum Jumps)**

---

## **🎯 Goal**
Minimum jumps to reach end.

---

## **🔥 Key Insight**
Use **level‑based greedy**:

- `current_end` = end of current jump range  
- `farthest` = farthest reachable index  
- When `i == current_end` → jump  

---

## **🔥 Steps**
1. Iterate through array  
2. Update `farthest`  
3. When `i == current_end`:  
   - jumps++  
   - current_end = farthest  

---

## **🧠 MEMORY TIP:**  
**Greedy BFS on array**

---

# **🌈 5.3 Jump Game III (Reach a Zero)**

---

## **🎯 Goal**
From index `start`, can you reach any index with value 0?

---

## **🔥 Key Insight**
Use BFS/DFS with visited array.

(Not greedy — but related family.)

---

# **🌈 6. Comparison Table**

| Problem | Greedy? | Key Idea | Why Greedy Works |
|--------|---------|----------|------------------|
| Activity Selection | Yes | Earliest finish | Leaves max room |
| Fractional Knapsack | Yes | Max ratio | Fractions allowed |
| Jump Game I | Yes | Max reach | Local reach = global reach |
| Jump Game II | Yes | Level jumps | BFS layers |
| 0/1 Knapsack | ❌ | DP | Greedy fails |

---

# **🌈 7. Pitfalls (Red Flags 🚩)**

- 🚩 Sorting by start time in Activity Selection (wrong)  
- 🚩 Using greedy for 0/1 knapsack  
- 🚩 Forgetting to update reach in Jump Game  
- 🚩 Not handling unreachable indices  
- 🚩 Using DP for Jump Game I (overkill)  
- 🚩 Using BFS for Jump Game II (TLE)
