# **Day 08 – 🚀 Sliding Window + Two Pointers (Colorful Memory Edition)**  
`theory.rst`

---

## **🌈 1. Why Sliding Window Matters**
Sliding window is the technique that turns:

- ❌ O(n²) brute force  
into  
- ✅ O(n) elegant solutions.

It is the **go‑to pattern** for:

- 🧵 Strings  
- 📏 Subarrays  
- 📊 Frequency windows  
- 🎯 Longest/shortest substring problems  
- 💡 Maintaining constraints (distinct chars, sum ≤ k, etc.)

Master this, and 40% of FAANG array/string problems become trivial.

---

# **🌟 MEMORY ANCHOR: “W‑E‑S‑T”**
Sliding window always involves:

- **W**indow  
- **E**xpand  
- **S**hrink  
- **T**rack  

If you remember **WEST**, you can solve any sliding window problem.

---

## **🧱 2. Types of Sliding Windows**

### **🟦 2.1 Fixed‑Size Window**
Window size = constant (k)

Used for:
- Maximum sum of size k  
- Count distinct in window  
- Moving averages  

### **🟩 2.2 Variable‑Size Window**
Window expands and shrinks based on constraints.

Used for:
- Longest substring without repeating  
- Longest substring with at most K distinct chars  
- Smallest subarray with sum ≥ target  

### **🟧 2.3 Two‑Pointer Window**
Used for:
- Sorted arrays  
- Pair sum problems  
- Removing duplicates  
- Partitioning  

---

# **🌈 3. Core Sliding Window Template (The Golden Pattern)**

### **💛 Expand**
Move `right` pointer → include new element.

### **❤️ Check Condition**
If window violates condition:
- Shrink from left  
- Update frequency map  
- Restore validity  

### **💙 Update Answer**
Whenever window is valid:
- Update max/min/length/count  

### **🧠 MEMORY ANCHOR:**  
**E‑C‑S‑U**  
Expand → Check → Shrink → Update

---

# **🌟 4. Sliding Window Patterns (Color‑Coded)**

---

## **💙 Pattern 1: Fixed‑Size Window**
Used when window size is known.

### **Examples**
- Max sum of subarray of size k  
- First negative number in every window  
- Count distinct elements in window  

### **🧠 MEMORY TIP:**  
Just slide → subtract left → add right.

---

## **💚 Pattern 2: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
Classic FAANG problem.

### **🎯 Idea**
Use HashMap to store last index of each char.

### **🧠 MEMORY ANCHOR:**  
If char repeats → jump left pointer to `last_index + 1`.

---

## **💛 Pattern 3: Longest Substring With At Most K Distinct Characters**
Maintain frequency map.

### **🎯 Condition**
While distinct > k → shrink.

---

## **💜 Pattern 4: Smallest Subarray With Sum ≥ Target**
Use variable window.

### **🎯 Condition**
While sum ≥ target → shrink and update answer.

---

## **🧡 Pattern 5: Subarrays With Sum ≤ K**
Used for:
- Count subarrays  
- Longest subarray  
- At most K operations  

### **🎯 Trick**
Maintain running sum and shrink when sum > k.

---

## **❤️ Pattern 6: Two‑Pointer Technique (Sorted Arrays)**
Used for:
- Pair sum  
- Triplet sum  
- Removing duplicates  
- Partitioning  

### **🧠 MEMORY ANCHOR:**  
Left pointer moves when sum too big  
Right pointer moves when sum too small

---

# **🌈 5. Frequency Map + Sliding Window (The Power Combo)**

Many string problems require:
- HashMap for frequency  
- Sliding window for boundaries  

### **Used in:**
- Minimum window substring  
- Longest substring with K distinct  
- Anagram detection  
- Permutation in string  

### **🧠 MEMORY TIP:**  
**Map tracks WHAT, window tracks WHERE.**

---

# **🌟 6. Advanced Sliding Window Patterns**

---

## **🔥 Pattern 7: Minimum Window Substring**
One of the hardest string problems.

### **🎯 Idea**
- Expand until all required chars are included  
- Shrink to find smallest valid window  

### **🧠 MEMORY ANCHOR:**  
**Grow → Satisfy → Shrink → Record**

---

## **⚡ Pattern 8: Sliding Window on Circular Arrays**
Use modulo indexing:
```
right = (right + 1) % n
```

---

## **🌪️ Pattern 9: Sliding Window + Prefix Sum**
Used for:
- Count subarrays with sum in range  
- Count subarrays divisible by k  

---

## **🌋 Pattern 10: Sliding Window + Binary Search**
Used for:
- Longest subarray with limit  
- Max average subarray  

---

# **🚩 7. Pitfalls (Red Flags)**

- 🚩 Forgetting to shrink window  
- 🚩 Shrinking incorrectly (not updating map)  
- 🚩 Using sliding window on unsorted arrays for two‑pointer problems  
- 🚩 Not updating answer at correct time  
- 🚩 Forgetting to remove zero‑frequency keys  
- 🚩 Using fixed window logic for variable window problems  

---

# **📚 8. Problems You Can Now Solve**
- Longest substring without repeating  
- Longest substring with at most K distinct  
- Minimum window substring  
- Count subarrays with sum ≤ k  
- Max sum of size k  
- First negative in every window  
- Pair sum (two pointers)  
- Triplet sum  
- Remove duplicates from sorted array  
- Smallest subarray with sum ≥ target

# **⏱️ 9. Complexity Summary**

| Pattern | Time | Space |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Fixed window | O(n) | O(1) |
| Variable window | O(n) | O(k) |
| Two pointers | O(n) | O(1) |
| Min window substring | O(n) | O(1)/O(26) |
| K distinct | O(n) | O(k) |
